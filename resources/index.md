If you do not already have a Coursera account, you will need to sign up for one.

If you would like to use your Duke ID for your account, you can go to https://www.coursera.org/sso/duke and click “Log In via Duke University”.

Select ‘audit’ when you enroll in the course to access the materials for free. Once you’ve enrolled the course, go to the course website, click ‘Go to Course’, and then click ‘Preview Course’ to view the videos.

From these links you will access:
